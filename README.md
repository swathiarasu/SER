# Emotion Recognition from Speech (SER)

This repository contains the code and experiments for the project **“Emotion Recognition from Speech Using CNNs and Wav2Vec2: A Comparative Study with Supplementary Analysis of Rudeness as a Social Tone Trait.”**

The project investigates how modern self-supervised speech representations compare against traditional spectrogram-based models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), with a particular emphasis on **cross-dataset generalization** and **robustness under domain shift**.

## Project Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) aims to identify human emotions from vocal signals by analyzing prosodic, spectral and temporal cues. While classical SER approaches rely on handcrafted features and convolutional architectures, recent self-supervised models such as **Wav2Vec2** learn rich representations directly from raw waveforms.

This project has two primary goals:

1. **Comparative Evaluation**  
   Compare a CNN-based mel-spectrogram baseline with a fine-tuned **Wav2Vec2** model for emotion recognition.

2. **Generalization & Social Traits**  
   Conduct a supplementary exploratory study on **rudeness** as a continuous social tone trait using IEMOCAP.

## Datasets

### CREMA-D
- 7,442 utterances from 91 actors
- 6 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad
- Used primarily for training

### RAVDESS
- 1,440 studio-quality recordings
- Distinct recording conditions and speakers
- Used to evaluate **cross-dataset generalization**

### IEMOCAP (Supplementary Study)
- Dyadic conversational dataset
- Used for exploratory annotation and analysis of **rudeness** as a social tone trait

---

## Models Implemented

### 1. CNN Baseline
- Input: Log-mel spectrograms
- Architecture: 4 convolutional layers + fully connected classifier
- Trained on CREMA-D, evaluated on RAVDESS
- Serves as a traditional SER baseline

### 2. Wav2Vec2-Based Model
- Pretrained self-supervised speech transformer
- Input: Raw waveform (16 kHz)
- Fine-tuned end-to-end with a linear classification head
- Demonstrates strong transfer and robustness under domain shift

## 🔍 Supplementary Study: Rudeness Detection

Beyond categorical emotions, we explore **rudeness** as a nuanced social tone trait:

- Manual annotation of rude vs. not-rude samples from IEMOCAP
- PCA and UMAP analysis of Wav2Vec2 embeddings
- Prosodic analysis (spectral centroid, RMS energy)
- Construction of a **rudeness trait vector**:
  
v_rude = mean(E_rude) − mean(E_not_rude)

**Finding:**  
Rudeness does not form a discrete class but occupies a consistent region in embedding space, supporting a **continuous trait-based modeling approach**.

## Notes & Limitations

CNN baseline is not state-of-the-art and serves as a reference point.

Rudeness annotations are limited in size and culturally subjective.

Fear and sadness remain challenging due to overlapping acoustic cues.

## Future Work
Multitask learning for emotion + social tone traits

Larger-scale rudeness annotation

Multimodal fusion (text, facial expressions)

Prosody-aware or attention-based pooling strategies
